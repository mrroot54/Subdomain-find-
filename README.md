# Subdomain-find-
Subdomain-Finder Tool  The Subdomain-Finder Tool, built with Bash and Subfinder, discovers subdomains for a given domain. It creates a folder on your desktop named after the domain, containing three files: domains.txt (all subdomains), httpx.txt (active domains with details), and alive-subdomains.txt (only active domains).
